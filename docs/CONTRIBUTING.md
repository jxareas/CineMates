When contributing, it's better to first discuss the change you wish to make via issue or discussion, or any other method

## Getting started

In order to make your contribution please make a fork of the repository. After you've pulled the code, follow these
steps to kick-start the development:

1. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
2. Run `yarn start` to launch demo project where you could test your changes.

## Pull Request Process

1. We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) in our commit messages, e.g.
   `feat(core): improve typing`, which are enforced via `husky`. For more information about this step, [follow our guide to Conventional Commits](./COMMIT.adoc).
2. Make sure you cover all code changes with unit tests
3. When you are ready, create a Pull Request of your fork into original repository
