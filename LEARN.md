## ü¶æ Technologies ü¶æ

This Angular project relies on various libraries and frameworks to enable the development of dynamic and feature-rich web applications. Here's an overview of the key dependencies:

- **Angular**: A comprehensive and widely-used framework that empowers the creation of dynamic, high-performance web applications.

- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It enhances the development experience by introducing static typing, improved tooling, and increased code reliability.

- **RxJs**: A reactive programming library that simplifies handling asynchronous and event-driven programming.

- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework that provides a variety of pre-designed components and styles for building responsive and visually appealing web interfaces.

- **ESLint**: A pluggable static code analysis tool used to identify problematic code patterns and maintain code quality in JavaScript and TypeScript.

- **Husky**: A git hook management tool that facilitates the execution of scripts or commands before Git events like commit or push.

- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that enforces consistent code style and formatting rules.

- **lint-staged**: A tool that enables running linters on staged files in a Git repository, working in conjunction with Husky to ensure code quality before committing.

- **animate.css**: A library for adding CSS animations to enhance user experience.

- **autoprefixer**: A tool that automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS properties for cross-browser compatibility.

- **font-awesome**: A library providing a collection of scalable vector icons for web application design.

Please note that the specific versions of these dependencies may change over time, so it's essential to keep them up to date for optimal functionality and security.
